"""
Create a Python function that accepts a string. This function should count the number of Xs and the number of Os
in the string. It should then return a boolean value of either True or False.

If the count of Xs and Os are equal, then the function should return True. If the count isnâ€™t the same, it should return
False.

If there are no Xs or Os in the string, it should also return True because 0 equals 0. The string can contain any type
and number of characters.
